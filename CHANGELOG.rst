Version 0.9 (unreleased)
------------------------

**Highlights of this release**

* Release the GIL for ``is_geometry()``, ``is_missing()``, and
  ``is_valid_input()`` (#207)
* Addition of a ``is_ccw()`` function for GEOS >= 3.7 (#201)
* Addition of a ``minimum_clearance`` function for GEOS >= 3.6.0 (#223)
* Addition of a ``offset_curve`` function (#229)
* Addition of a ``relate_pattern`` function (#245)
* Added support for pickling to ``Geometry`` objects (#190)
* Limited the length of geometry repr to 80 characters (#189)
* Argument in ``line_interpolate_point`` and ``line_locate_point``
  was renamed from ``normalize`` to ``normalized`` (#209)
* Fixed error handling in ``line_locate_point`` for incorrect geometry
  types, now actually requiring line and point geometries (#216)
* Addition of ``get_parts`` function to get individual parts of an array of multipart
  geometries (#197).
* The ``apply`` function for coordinate transformations and the ``set_coordinates``
  function now support geometries with z-coordinates (#131).
* Addition of Cython and internal PyGEOS C API to enable easier development of internal
  functions (previously all significant internal functions were developed in C) (#51).
* API change: geometry and counting functions (``get_num_coordinates``,
  ``get_num_geometries``, ``get_num_interior_rings``, ``get_num_points``) now return 0
  for ``None`` input values instead of -1 (#218).
* API change: ``intersection_all`` and ``symmetric_difference_all`` now ignore None values
  instead of returning None if any value is None (#249).
* API change: ``union_all`` now returns None (instead of ``GEOMETRYCOLLECTION EMPTY``) if
  all input values are None (#249).
* Fixed internal GEOS error code detection for ``get_dimensions`` and ``get_srid`` (#218).
* Addition of ``prepare`` function that generates a GEOS prepared geometry which is stored on
  the Geometry object itself. All binary predicates (except ``equals``) make use of this (#92).
* Use previously prepared geometries within ``STRtree`` ``query`` and ``query_bulk``
  functions if available (#246).
* Ensure that ``python setup.py clean`` removes all previously Cythonized and compiled
  files (#239).
* Addition of a ``reverse`` function for GEOS >= 3.7 (#254).
* Addition of ``get_precision`` to get precision of a geometry and ``set_precision``
  to set the precision of a geometry (may round and reduce coordinates).

Version 0.8 (2020-09-06)
------------------------

**Highlights of this release**

* Handle multi geometries in ``boundary`` (#188)
* Handle empty points in to_wkb by conversion to POINT (nan, nan) (#179)
* Prevent segfault in to_wkt (and repr) with empty points in multipoints (#171)
* Fixed bug in ``multilinestrings()``, it now accepts linearrings again (#168)
* Release the GIL to allow for multithreading in functions that do not
  create geometries (#144) and in the STRtree ``query_bulk()`` method (#174)
* Addition of a ``frechet_distance()`` function for GEOS >= 3.7 (#144)
* Addition of ``coverage_union()`` and ``coverage_union_all()`` functions
  for GEOS >= 3.8 (#142)
* Fixed segfaults when adding empty geometries to the STRtree (#147)
* Addition of ``include_z=True`` keyword in the ``get_coordinates()`` function
  to get 3D coordinates (#178)
* Addition of a ``build_area()`` function for GEOS >= 3.8 (#141)
* Addition of a ``normalize()`` function (#136)
* Addition of a ``make_valid()`` function for GEOS >= 3.8 (#107)
* Addition of a ``get_z()`` function for GEOS >= 3.7 (#175)
* Addition of a ``relate()`` function (#186)
* The ``get_coordinate_dimensions()`` function was renamed to
  ``get_coordinate_dimension()`` for consistency with GEOS (#176)
* Addition of ``covers``, ``covered_by``, ``contains_properly`` predicates
  to STRtree ``query`` and ``query_bulk`` (#157)

* STRtree improvements for spatial indexing:
  * Directly include predicate evaluation in ``STRtree.query()`` (#87)
  * Query multiple input geometries (spatial join style) with ``STRtree.query_bulk`` (#108)
* Addition of a ``total_bounds()`` function (#107)
* Geometries are now hashable, and can be compared with ``==`` or ``!=`` (#102)
* Fixed bug in ``create_collections()`` with wrong types (#86)
* Fixed a reference counting bug in STRtree (#97, #100)
* Start of a benchmarking suite using ASV (#96)
* This is the first release that will provide wheels!

------------------------

Highlights of this release:

* Addition of the STRtree class for spatial indexing (#58)

Version 0.5 (2019-10-25)
------------------------

Highlights of this release:

* Moved to the pygeos GitHub organization.
* Addition of functionality to get and transform all coordinates (eg for reprojections or affine transformations) [#44]
* Ufuncs for converting to and from the WKT and WKB formats [#45]
* ``equals_exact`` has been added [PR #57]


Version 0.4 (2019-09-16)
------------------------

This is a major release of PyGEOS and the first one with actual release notes. Most important features of this release are:

* ``buffer`` and ``haussdorff_distance`` were completed  [#15]
* ``voronoi_polygons`` and ``delaunay_triangles`` have been added [#17]
* The PyGEOS documentation is now mostly complete and available on http://pygeos.readthedocs.io .
* The concepts of "empty" and "missing" geometries have been separated. The ``pygeos.Empty`` and ``pygeos.NaG`` objects has been removed. Empty geometries are handled the same as normal geometries. Missing geometries are denoted by ``None`` and are handled by every pygeos function. ``NaN`` values cannot be used anymore to denote missing geometries. [PR #36]
* Added ``pygeos.__version__`` and ``pygeos.geos_version``. [PR #43]
